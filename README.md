# mcedit-filter-mapify
McEdit filter "Mapify" that replaces blocks at Y=255 with selected block if there is a block in that column of the selection.

Effectively allows you to automatically generate workiing custom maps for CTM maps that have a bedrock layer at the top of the world covering up the whole world.

This filter is WIP and is probably going to get improved. Due to the way it's working now, it is mostly useful for void maps (maps that mostly build positive space).
